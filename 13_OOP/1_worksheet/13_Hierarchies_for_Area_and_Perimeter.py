'''
Scenario:
Simulate a graphics editor: various shapes with their own formulas.

What youâ€™ll learn:
Creating class hierarchies
Overriding methods for specialized behavior

Task:
Write a Shape base class, then subclasses for Circle, Triangle, and Square, each with its own area/perimeter.

Example:
If you create a Triangle with base 6 and height 4 and call area():

Expected Output:
12.0
