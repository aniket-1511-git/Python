Concepts: 
Using Pythonâ€™s unittest or pytest modules to write and run test cases. 
Task: 
Write unit tests for one or more of the functions developed (e.g., log parsing or regex matching). 
Validation: 
Ensure that all tests pass when the functions are correct and that failures are appropriately flagged when introducing errors
