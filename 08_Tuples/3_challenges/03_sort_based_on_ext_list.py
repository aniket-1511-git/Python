Description: Order a list of tuples using an external list that defines the custom order for sorting.
This skill is valuable for implementing custom sorting logic when default Python sorting isn't sufficient.
Input: lst = [('b', 2), ('a', 1), ('c', 3)], order = ['a', 'b', 'c']
Output: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
